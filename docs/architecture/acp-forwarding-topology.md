## Three-Layer View

This view separates what the app sees, what the bridge owns, and what the
real upstream production targets are. The upstream ACP and gateway services
exist independently, but for the app they are all accessed through the single
public bridge origin: `https://xworkmate-bridge.svc.plus`.

Important distinction:

- the upstream services are independent production services, not embedded
  inside the bridge
- for the app, ACP discovery, session execution, and gateway runtime traffic
  are all proxied through `https://xworkmate-bridge.svc.plus`
- upstream authentication is unified through
  `Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`
- `acp.capabilities.providerCatalog` currently advertises only the ACP
  single-agent providers: `codex`, `opencode`, and `gemini`
- `gateway` is not part of that provider catalog; it is exposed through the
  separate `xworkmate.gateway.*` bridge-owned runtime path
- for remote gateway mode, the bridge rewrites the upstream target to
  `wss://openclaw.svc.plus`

## Production Truth

The production upstream services exist independently. The bridge owns the
routing map used to proxy app traffic to them:

- `codex` -> `https://acp-server.svc.plus/codex/acp/rpc`
- `opencode` -> `https://acp-server.svc.plus/opencode/acp/rpc`
- `gemini` -> `https://acp-server.svc.plus/gemini/acp/rpc`
- gateway -> `wss://openclaw.svc.plus`

Upstream auth is unified and bridge-internal:

- `Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`

Canonical APP-facing paths stay on the bridge origin:

- `POST https://xworkmate-bridge.svc.plus/acp/rpc`
- `GET  https://xworkmate-bridge.svc.plus/acp`

## Invariants

- app-facing cloud entry is only `https://xworkmate-bridge.svc.plus`
- app traffic reaches upstream ACP and gateway services only through the
  bridge proxy
- upstream ACP and gateway routes use the same bearer token contract:
  `Authorization: Bearer $INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`
- `acp.capabilities` returns the built-in production catalog
- no production `xworkmate.providers.sync`
- no app direct call to `acp-server.svc.plus/*`
- no app direct call to `openclaw.svc.plus`
- remote gateway runtime status is reported as `openclaw.svc.plus:443`, but the app still talks only to the bridge
